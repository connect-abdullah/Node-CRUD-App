# 🌟 CRUD App (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) 🌟

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. The app allows users to manage a collection of users by adding, editing, and deleting them. It was built for learning purposes to understand backend development concepts such as working with databases, handling HTTP requests, and using server-side rendering.

## 🚀 Live Demo  
👉 **[Node-CRUD-App](node-crud-app-phi.vercel.app)** 👈  
🌱 Deployed on **Vercel**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to build the backend of the application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, making it easier to interact with the database.
- **EJS**: Templating engine used for rendering dynamic HTML views.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework used for styling the application with responsive and clean design.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed to:
- Learn how to build a simple backend application with **Node.js** and **Express**.
- Understand how to interact with a **MongoDB** database for CRUD operations.
- Practice **server-side rendering** using **EJS** templates.
- Implement routing and request handling for basic web applications.

## 💻 Features

- **User Management**: Add, edit, and delete users.
- **Data Persistence**: User data is stored in MongoDB.
